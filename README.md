# Shadow Trail

**Shadow Trail** is an interactive horror game built for Twitch and Discord using real-time choices, branching narrative logic, and live audience interaction.

Designed by Shyra Mills, this game transforms traditional horror into a psychological, story-driven experience. Players enter a twisted trail of choices where one wrong move could mean permanent digital death â€” and every decision impacts the story.
